            <h2>Able to work in a team or individual</h2>
            <p>Other people may find it hard to work in a team as they need to follow the leader's instruction.
                As for me, I think I am able to give cooperation when working in a team. To be frank, I enjoy
                working in a team. For me, the spirit of a good teamwork makes you feel energetic. 
                On the other hand, I still can work as an individual. With the help of the colleagues to guide, 
                I definitely can get my work done.

            <h2>Have management knowledge</h2>
            <p>
                During my degree years, I have learned on how management works. I personally feel that management is 
                one of the core factors in contribution towards a successful organization or company. There are management 
                functions such as planning and organizing. These functions is important in making a successful company model. 
                Having the basic knowledge would make me aware and alert of the working environment. It gives me an insight
                that I have to be ready in whatever circumstances that I may face. Also, the knowledge would be useful in
                understanding how a particular organization should be operating.

            <h2>Improved communication Skill</h2>
            <p>
                Communication skill is very important in working environment. I will be meeting a lot of people to have a 
                business deal or even to work with. I have learned on how to improvise my communication skill through working 
                experience and socializing so that I would not have trouble in communicating with people. Poor commmunication 
                skill can lead to the frequent misunderstanding.
