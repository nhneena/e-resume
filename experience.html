            <h2>Working at a convenience store</h2>
            <p>I had an experience working at a convenience store. Down to the side, eventhough working at convenience 
                store may seem simple, from my experience, working there helps me boost up my self-confidence. It is 
                because I served a variety of customers each day, with different personality. It teaches me on how control 
                my emotion because I need to be able to control my emotion and be professional in handling them. Hence, 
                having an experience Working at convenience store helps me in improving my social skill including 
                the communication skill.

            <h2>Freelance as a content writer</h2>
            <p>I had an experience of doing a freelance work as a content writer. The experience that I had helps me to
                view the work environment in different point of view. It is because I am dealing with real people.
                It guides me in becoming a more discipline person as I need to work within the deadline given.
